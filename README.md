This Prediction Challenge is modelled after the 2015 Facebook Recruitment Challenge, a prediction competition jointly held by Facebook and Kaggle. 
Those whom trail-blazed their way to the top of the leaderboard each earned themselves an opportunity at interviewing for a role as a software engineer at Facebook, working on world-class Machine Learning problems.
In this competition, you'll be chasing down robots for an online auction site. 

Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. 
As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting.
In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. 
Their attempt at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven insufficient.

The goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity.

There are two datasets in this competition. One is a bidder dataset that includes a list of bidder information, including their id, payment account, and address. 
The other is a bid dataset that includes more than a million bids on different auctions. The bids in this dataset are all made by mobile devices.

The online auction platform has a fixed increment of dollar amount for each bid, so it doesn't include an amount for each bid. 
You are welcome to learn the bidding behavior from the time of the bids, the auction, or the device.

The data in this competition comes from an online platform, not from Facebook.

File descriptions
train.csv - the training set from the bidder dataset
test.csv - the test set from the bidder dataset
sample-submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
bids.csv - the bid dataset

Data fields For the bidder dataset
bidder_id – Unique identifier of a bidder.
payment_account – Payment account associated with a bidder. These are obfuscated to protect privacy.
address – Mailing address of a bidder. These are obfuscated to protect privacy.
outcome – Label of a bidder indicating whether or not it is a robot. Value 1.0 indicates a robot, where value 0.0 indicates human.

The outcome was half hand labeled, half stats-based. There are two types of "bots" with different levels of proof:
1. Bidders who are identified as bots/fraudulent with clear proof. Their accounts were banned by the auction site.
2. Bidder who may have just started their business/clicks or their stats exceed from system wide average. There are no clear proof that they are bots.

For the bid dataset

bid_id - unique id for this bid
bidder_id – Unique identifier of a bidder (same as the bidder_id used in train.csv and test.csv)
auction – Unique identifier of an auction
merchandise – The category of the auction site campaign, which means the bidder might come to this site by way of searching for "home goods" but ended up bidding for "sporting goods" - and that leads to this field being "home goods". This categorical field could be a search term, or online advertisement.
device – Phone model of a visitor
time - Time that the bid is made (transformed to protect privacy).
country - The country that the IP belongs to
ip – IP address of a bidder (obfuscated to protect privacy).
url - url where the bidder was referred from (obfuscated to protect privacy).
